# Translating Guide

## Introduction

It is possible to translate the website to other languages and anyone is very welcome.

Note that we're taking translations very seriously.
They should receive as much love as the English version.

For example, Google Translate is already built into Google Chrome.
Don't bother using software to create translations of the docs.
If we create a translation of the docs for a new language, then because we want high quality translations written by native speakers or near-native speakers.
Examples and real-world comparisons must be replaced by equivalents in the culture of the respective country.
A good translation is hard and it takes time. We don't want partial or outdated translations.

## The Translation Workflow

Translating the grammY docs into a language happens in two stages: the Active Stage and the Maintenance Stage.

When a language is first started, no translations are available.
Hence, the complete website must be translated actively (Active Stage).
This requires an insane amount of work and a fair bit of dedication (as you all know).
Respect to everyone who makes it through this.

The language will then enter Maintenance Stage.
From here on, all that needs to be done is to keep notifications on for new pull requests, and sync the translations whenever an article gets updated.

Here is some more information about each stage works.

### Active Stage

A translation to another language must be 100% completed before it gets published.
We do not accept partial translations.
All menus, links, articles, comments, and everything translatable must be localised before they can go live on the website.

It would be a pain in the butt to do everything in a single pull request, so we developed a simple branching model which will make this easy.

Once you start working on a new language, we will give you access to the repository.
You can then create a new branch for the translations, e.g. `feat/spanish-translations`.
This is called the translation branch of your language.

For every page you translate, create a new branch, perform the translations, and open a pull request.
Make sure to open a pull request against your translation branch, and not against `main`.

A different person who can speak your language can now review the pull request. Make sure to reiterate on the translations, in case if you have ideas to improve it.
Once you both think that the translation is perfect, merge the pull request into the translation branch of your language.

You should keep track of which pages are translated in your translation tracking issue.
If we update an article that is already translated, you need to open a new pull request against your translation branch which syncs up the changes.
That way, it is always guaranteed that the articles in the translation branch are up to date.

Once everything is translated, the translation branch can be merged into `main`.
Your translations go live immediately.
Your language has now entered the Maintenance Stage.

### Maintenance Stage

Your language is 100% translated and perfectly in sync with the English original.
Great job! At this point, all you need to do is to keep it that way.

Whenever an English article is updated (by us, you or anyone else), a pull request will be opened.
It usually takes some time before we get the content right, so don't bother translating anything at this point yet.

Once the content is finalised, we add the "ready for translation" label.
This is a guarantee that the English version is not going to change anymore. You should now push more commits to the existing branch which sync up the changes to your language.
It is recommended to have a second person review your translations, but this is less strict than in the Active Stage.

Once you are satisfied with your work, add the label of your language, e.g. "ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ ES".
Now we have a good overview over which translations are done and which ones are missing.
As soon as all translations are added (this usually takes 2-3 days), the pull request can be merged. The change immediately goes live for all languages at the same time.

Some pull requests do not require a translation. They are labeled not translatable. You can safely ignore them.
