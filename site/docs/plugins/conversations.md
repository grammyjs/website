# Conversations (`conversations`)

Create powerful conversational interfaces with ease.

## Quickstart

Conversations let you wait for messages.
Use this plugin if your bot has multiple steps.

> Conversations are unique because they introduce a novel concept that you won't find elsewhere in the world.
> They provide an elegant solution, but you will need to read a bit about how they work before you understand what your code actually does.

Here is a quickstart to let you play around with the plugin before we get to the interesting parts.

:::code-group

```ts [TypeScript]
import { Bot, type Context } from "grammy";
import {
  type Conversation,
  type ConversationFlavor,
  conversations,
  createConversation,
} from "@grammyjs/conversations";

const bot = new Bot<ConversationFlavor<Context>>(""); // <-- put your bot token between the "" (https://t.me/BotFather)
bot.use(conversations());

/** Defines the conversation */
async function hello(conversation: Conversation, ctx: Context) {
  await ctx.reply("Hi there! What is your name?");
  const { message } = await conversation.waitFor("message:text");
  await ctx.reply(`Welcome to the chat, ${message.text}!`);
}
bot.use(createConversation(hello));

bot.command("enter", async (ctx) => {
  // Enter the function "hello" you declared.
  await ctx.conversation.enter("hello");
});

bot.start();
```

```js [JavaScript]
const { Bot } = require("grammy");
const { conversations, createConversation } = require(
  "@grammyjs/conversations",
);

const bot = new Bot(""); // <-- put your bot token between the "" (https://t.me/BotFather)
bot.use(conversations());

/** Defines the conversation */
async function hello(conversation, ctx) {
  await ctx.reply("Hi there! What is your name?");
  const { message } = await conversation.waitFor("message:text");
  await ctx.reply(`Welcome to the chat, ${message.text}!`);
}
bot.use(createConversation(hello));

bot.command("enter", async (ctx) => {
  // Enter the function "hello" you declared.
  await ctx.conversation.enter("hello");
});

bot.start();
```

```ts [Deno]
import { Bot, type Context } from "https://deno.land/x/grammy/mod.ts";
import {
  type Conversation,
  type ConversationFlavor,
  conversations,
  createConversation,
} from "https://deno.land/x/grammy_conversations/mod.ts";

const bot = new Bot<ConversationFlavor<Context>>(""); // <-- put your bot token between the "" (https://t.me/BotFather)
bot.use(conversations());

/** Defines the conversation */
async function hello(conversation: Conversation, ctx: Context) {
  await ctx.reply("Hi there! What is your name?");
  const { message } = await conversation.waitFor("message:text");
  await ctx.reply(`Welcome to the chat, ${message.text}!`);
}
bot.use(createConversation(hello));

bot.command("enter", async (ctx) => {
  // Enter the function "hello" you declared.
  await ctx.conversation.enter("hello");
});

bot.start();
```

:::

When you enter the above conversation `hello`, it will send a message, then wait for a text message by the user, and then send another message.
Finally, the conversation completes.

Let's now get to the interesting parts.

## How Conversations Work

Take a look at the following example of traditional message handling.

```ts
bot.on("message", async (ctx) => {
  // handle one message
});
```

In regular message handlers, you only have a single context object at all times.

Compare this with conversations.

```ts
async function hello(conversation: Conversation, ctx0: Context) {
  const ctx1 = await conversation.wait();
  const ctx2 = await conversation.wait();
  // handle three messages
}
```

In this conversation, you have three context objects available!

Like regular handlers, the conversations plugin only receives a single context object from the [middleware system](../guide/middleware).
Now suddenly it makes three context objects available to you.
How is this possible?

**Conversation builder functions are not executed like normal functions**.
(Even though we can program them that way.)

### Conversations Are Replay Engines

Conversation builder functions are not executed like normal functions.

When a conversation is entered, it will only be executed up until the first wait call.
The function is then interrupted and won't be executed any further.
The plugin remembers that the wait call has been reached and stores this information.

When the next update arrives, the conversation will be executed again from the start.
However, this time, none of the API calls are performed, which makes your code run very fast and not have any effects.
This is called a _replay_.
As soon as the previously reached wait call is reached once again, function execution resumes normally.

::: code-group

```ts [Enter]
async function hello( //                      |
  conversation: Conversation, //              |
  ctx0: Context, //                           |
) { //                                        |
  await ctx0.reply("Hi there!"); //           |
  const ctx1 = await conversation.wait(); //  A
  await ctx1.reply("Hello again!"); //
  const ctx2 = await conversation.wait(); //
  await ctx2.reply("Goodbye!"); //
} //
```

```ts [Replay]
async function hello( //                      .
  conversation: Conversation, //              .
  ctx0: Context, //                           .
) { //                                        .
  await ctx0.reply("Hi there!"); //           .
  const ctx1 = await conversation.wait(); //  A
  await ctx1.reply("Hello again!"); //        |
  const ctx2 = await conversation.wait(); //  B
  await ctx2.reply("Goodbye!"); //
} //
```

```ts [Replay 2]
async function hello( //                      .
  conversation: Conversation, //              .
  ctx0: Context, //                           .
) { //                                        .
  await ctx0.reply("Hi there!"); //           .
  const ctx1 = await conversation.wait(); //  A
  await ctx1.reply("Hello again!"); //        .
  const ctx2 = await conversation.wait(); //  B
  await ctx2.reply("Goodbye!"); //            |
} //                                          â€”
```

:::

1. When the conversation is entered, the function will run until `A`.
2. When the next update arrives, the function will be replayed until `A`, and run normally from `A` until `B`.
3. When the last update arrives, the function will be replayed until `B`, and run normally until the end.

This means that each line of code you write will be executed many times---once normally, and many more times during replays.
As a result, you have to make sure that your code behaves the same way during replays as it did when it was first executed.

If you perform any API calls via `ctx.api` (including `ctx.reply`), the plugin takes care of them automatically.
In contrast, your own database communication needs special treatment.

This is done as follows.

### The Golden Rule of Conversations

Now that [we know how conversations are executed](#conversations-are-replay-engines), we can define one rule that applies to the code you write inside a conversation builder function.
You must follow it if you want your code to behave correctly.

::: warning THE GOLDEN RULE

**Code behaving differently between replays must be wrapped in [`conversation.external`](/ref/conversations/conversation#external).**

:::

This is how to apply it:

```ts
// BAD
const response = await accessDatabase();
// GOOD
const response = await conversation.external(() => accessDatabase());
```

Escaping a part of your code via [`conversation.external`](/ref/conversations/conversation#external) signals to the plugin that this part of the code should be skipped during replays.
The return value of the wrapped code is stored by the plugin and reused during subsequent replays.
In the above example, this prevents repeated database access.

USE `conversation.external` when you ...

- read or write to files, databases/sessions, the network, or global state,
- call `Math.random()` or `Date.now()`,
- perform API calls on `bot.api` or other independent instances of `Api`.

DO NOT USE `conversation.external` when you ...

- call `ctx.reply` or other [context actions](../guide/context#available-actions),
- call `ctx.api.sendMessage` or other methods of the [Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) via `ctx.api`.

The conversations plugin provides a few convenience methods around `conversation.external`.
This not only simplifies using `Math.random()` and `Date.now()`, but it also simplifies debugging by providing a way to suppress logs during a replay.

```ts
// await conversation.external(() => Math.random());
const rnd = await conversation.random();
// await conversation.external(() => Date.now());
const now = await conversation.now();
// await conversation.external(() => console.log("abc"));
await conversation.log("abc");
```

How can `conversation.wait` and `conversation.external` recover the original values when a replay happens?
The plugin has to somehow remember this data, right?

Yes.

### Conversations Store State

Two types of data are being stored in a database.
By default, it uses a lightweight in-memory database that is based on a `Map`, but you can [use a persistent database](#persisting-conversations) easily.

1. The conversations plugin stores all updates.
2. The conversations plugin stores all return values of `conversation.external` and the results of all API calls.

This is not an issue if you only have a few dozen updates in a conversation.
(Remember that during long polling, every call to `getUpdates` retrieves up to 100 updates, too.)

However, if your conversation never exits, this data will accumulate and slow down your bot.
**Avoid infinite loops.**

### Conversational Context Objects

When a conversation is executed, it uses the persisted updates to generate new context objects from scratch.
**These context objects are different from the context object in the surrounding middleware.**
For TypeScript code, this also means that you now have two [flavors](../guide/context#context-flavors) of context objects.

- **Outside context objects** are the context objects that your bot uses in middleware.
  They give you access to `ctx.conversation.enter`.
  For TypeScript, they will at least have `ConversationFlavor` installed.
  Outside context objects will also have other properties defined by plugins that you installed via `bot.use`.
- **Inside context objects** (also called **conversational context objects**) are the context objects created by the conversations plugin.
  They can never have access to `ctx.conversation.enter`, and by default, they also don't have access to any plugins.
  If you want to have custom properties on inside context objects, [scroll down](#using-plugins-inside-conversations).

You have to pass both the outside and the inside context types to the conversation.
The TypeScript setup therefore typically looks as follows:

::: code-group

```ts [Node.js]
import { Bot, type Context } from "grammy";
import {
  type Conversation,
  type ConversationFlavor,
} from "@grammyjs/conversations";

// Outside context objects (knows all middleware plugins)
type MyContext = ConversationFlavor<Context>;
// Inside context objects (knows all conversation plugins)
type MyConversationContext = Context;

// Use the outside context type for your bot.
const bot = new Bot<MyContext>(""); // <-- put your bot token between the "" (https://t.me/BotFather)

// Use both the outside and the inside type for your conversation.
type MyConversation = Conversation<MyContext, MyConversationContext>;

// Define your conversation.
async function example(
  conversation: MyConversation,
  ctx0: MyConversationContext,
) {
  // All context objects inside the conversation are
  // of type `MyConversationContext`.
  const ctx1 = await conversation.wait();

  // The outside context object can be accessed
  // via `conversation.external` and it is inferred to be
  // of type `MyContext`.
  const session = await conversation.external((ctx) => ctx.session);
}
```

```ts [Deno]
import { Bot, type Context } from "https://deno.land/x/grammy/mod.ts";
import {
  type Conversation,
  type ConversationFlavor,
} from "https://deno.land/x/grammy_conversations/mod.ts";

// Outside context objects (knows all middleware plugins)
type MyContext = ConversationFlavor<Context>;
// Inside context objects (knows all conversation plugins)
type MyConversationContext = Context;

// Use the outside context type for your bot.
const bot = new Bot<MyContext>(""); // <-- put your bot token between the "" (https://t.me/BotFather)

// Use both the outside and the inside type for your conversation.
type MyConversation = Conversation<MyContext, MyConversationContext>;

// Define your conversation.
async function example(
  conversation: MyConversation,
  ctx0: MyConversationContext,
) {
  // All context objects inside the conversation are
  // of type `MyConversationContext`.
  const ctx1 = await conversation.wait();

  // The outside context object can be accessed
  // via `conversation.external` and it is inferred to be
  // of type `MyContext`.
  const session = await conversation.external((ctx) => ctx.session);
}
```

:::

> In the above example, there are no plugins installed in the conversation.
> As soon as you start [installing](#using-plugins-inside-conversations) them, the definition of `MyConversationContext` will no longer be the bare type `Context`.

Naturally, if you have several conversations and you want the context types to differ between them, you can define several conversational context types.

Congrats!
If you have understood all of the above, the hard parts are over.
The rest of the page is about the wealth of features that this plugin provides.

## Entering Conversations

Conversations can be entered from a normal handler.

By default, a conversation has the same name as the [name](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/name) of the function.
Optionally, you can rename it when installing it on your bot.

Optionally, you can pass arguments to the conversation.
Note that the arguments will be stored as a JSON string, so you need to make sure they can be safely passed to `JSON.stringify`.

Conversations can also be entered from within other conversations by doing a normal JavaScript function call.
In that case, they get access to a potential return value of the called conversation.
This isn't available when you enter a conversation from inside middleware.

:::code-group

```ts [TypeScript]
/**
 * Returns the answer to life, the universe, and everything.
 * This value is only accessible when the conversation
 * is called from another conversation.
 */
async function convo(conversation: Conversation, ctx: Context) {
  await ctx.reply("Computing answer");
  return 42;
}
/** Accepts two arguments (must be JSON-serializable) */
async function args(
  conversation: Conversation,
  ctx: Context,
  answer: number,
  config: { text: string },
) {
  const truth = await convo(conversation, ctx);
  if (answer === truth) {
    await ctx.reply(config.text);
  }
}
bot.use(createConversation(convo, "new-name"));
bot.use(createConversation(args));

bot.command("enter", async (ctx) => {
  await ctx.conversation.enter("new-name");
});
bot.command("enter_with_arguments", async (ctx) => {
  await ctx.conversation.enter("args", 42, { text: "foo" });
});
```

```js [JavaScript]
/**
 * Returns the answer to life, the universe, and everything.
 * This value is only accessible when the conversation
 * is called from another conversation.
 */
async function convo(conversation, ctx) {
  await ctx.reply("Computing answer");
  return 42;
}
/** Accepts two arguments (must be JSON-serializable) */
async function args(conversation, ctx, answer, config) {
  const truth = await convo(conversation, ctx);
  if (answer === truth) {
    await ctx.reply(config.text);
  }
}
bot.use(createConversation(convo, "new-name"));
bot.use(createConversation(args));

bot.command("enter", async (ctx) => {
  await ctx.conversation.enter("new-name");
});
bot.command("enter_with_arguments", async (ctx) => {
  await ctx.conversation.enter("args", 42, { text: "foo" });
});
```

:::

::: warning Missing Type Safety for Arguments

Double-check that you used the right type annotations for the parameters of your conversation, and that you passed matching arguments to it in your `enter` call.
The plugin is not able to check any types beyond `conversation` and `ctx`.

:::

Remember that [the order of your middleware matters](../guide/middleware).
You can only enter conversations that have been installed prior to the handler that calls `enter`.

## Waiting for Updates

The most basic kind of wait call just waits for any update.

```ts
const ctx = await conversation.wait();
```

It simply returns a context object.
All other wait calls are based on this.

### Filtered Wait Calls

If you want to wait for a specific type of update, you can use a filtered wait call.

```ts
// Match a filter query like with `bot.on`.
const message = await conversation.waitFor("message");
// Wait for text like with `bot.hears`.
const hears = await conversation.waitForHears(/regex/);
// Wait for commands like with `bot.command`.
const start = await conversation.waitForCommand("start");
// etc
```

Take a look at the API reference to see [all the available ways to filter wait calls](/ref/conversations/conversation#wait).

Filtered wait calls are guaranteed to return only update that match the respective filter.
If the bot receives an update that does not match, it will be dropped.
You can pass a callback function that will be invoked in this case.

```ts
const message = await conversation.waitFor(":photo", {
  otherwise: (ctx) => ctx.reply("Please send a photo!"),
});
```

All filtered wait calls can be chained to filter for several things at once.

```ts
// Wait for a photo with a specific caption
let photoWithCaption = await conversation.waitFor(":photo")
  .andForHears("XY");
// Handle each case with a different otherwise function:
photoWithCaption = await conversation
  .waitFor(":photo", { otherwise: (ctx) => ctx.reply("No photo") })
  .andForHears("XY", { otherwise: (ctx) => ctx.reply("Bad caption") });
```

If you only specify `otherwise` in one of the chained wait calls, then it will only be invoked if that specific filter drops the update.

### Inspecting Context Objects

It is very common to [destructure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) the received context objects.
You can then perform further checks on the received data.

```ts
const { message } = await conversation.waitFor("message");
if (message.photo) {
  // Handle photo message
}
```

Conversations are also an ideal place to use [has checks](../guide/context#probing-via-has-checks).

## Exiting Conversations

The easiest way to exit a conversation is to return from it.
Throwing an error also terminates the conversation.

If this is not enough, you can manually halt the conversation at any moment.

```ts
async function convo(conversation: Conversation, ctx: Context) {
  // All branches exit the conversation:
  if (ctx.message?.text === "return") {
    return;
  } else if (ctx.message?.text === "error") {
    throw new Error("boom");
  } else {
    await conversation.halt(); // never returns
  }
}
```

You can also exit a conversation from your middleware.

```ts
bot.use(conversations());
bot.command("clean", async (ctx) => {
  await ctx.conversation.exit("convo");
});
```

You can even do this _before_ the targeted conversation is installed on your middleware system.
It is enough to have the conversations plugin itself installed.

## It's Just JavaScript

With [side-effects out of the way](#the-golden-rule-of-conversations), conversations are just regular JavaScript functions.
They might be executed in weird ways, but when developing a bot, you can usually forget this.
All the regular JavaScript syntax just works.

Most the things in this section are obvious if you have used conversations for some time.
However, if you are new, some of these things could surprise you.

### Variables, Branching, and Loops

You can use normal variables to store state between updates.
You can use branching with `if` or `switch`.
Loops via `for` and `while` work, too.

```ts
await ctx.reply("Send me your favorite numbers, separated by commas!");
const { message } = await conversation.waitFor("message:text");
const numbers = message.text.split(",");
let sum = 0;
for (const str of numbers) {
  const n = parseInt(str.trim(), 10);
  if (!isNaN(n)) {
    sum += n;
  }
}
await ctx.reply("The sum of these numbers is: " + sum);
```

It's just JavaScript.

### Functions and Recursion

You can split a conversation into multiple functions.
They can call each other and even do recursion.
(In fact, the plugin does not even know that you used functions.)

Here is the same code as above, refactored to functions.

:::code-group

```ts [TypeScript]
/** A conversation to add numbers */
async function sumConvo(conversation: Conversation, ctx: Context) {
  await ctx.reply("Send me your favorite numbers, separated by commas!");
  const { message } = await conversation.waitFor("message:text");
  const numbers = message.text.split(",");
  await ctx.reply("The sum of these numbers is: " + sumStrings(numbers));
}

/** Converts all given strings to numbers and adds them up */
function sumStrings(numbers: string[]): number {
  let sum = 0;
  for (const str of numbers) {
    const n = parseInt(str.trim(), 10);
    if (!isNaN(n)) {
      sum += n;
    }
  }
  return sum;
}
```

```js [JavaScript]
/** A conversation to add numbers */
async function sumConvo(conversation, ctx) {
  await ctx.reply("Send me your favorite numbers, separated by commas!");
  const { message } = await conversation.waitFor("message:text");
  const numbers = message.text.split(",");
  await ctx.reply("The sum of these numbers is: " + sumStrings(numbers));
}

/** Converts all given strings to numbers and adds them up */
function sumStrings(numbers) {
  let sum = 0;
  for (const str of numbers) {
    const n = parseInt(str.trim(), 10);
    if (!isNaN(n)) {
      sum += n;
    }
  }
  return sum;
}
```

:::

It's just JavaScript.

### Modules and Classes

JavaScript has higher-order functions, classes, and other ways of structuring your code into modules.
Naturally, all of them can be turned into conversations.

Here is the above code once again, refactored to a module with simple dependency injection.

::: code-group

```ts [TypeScript]
/**
 * A module that can ask the user for numbers, and that
 * provides a way to add up numbers sent by the user.
 *
 * Requires a conversation handle to be injected.
 */
function sumModule(conversation: Conversation) {
  /** Converts all given strings to numbers and adds them up */
  function sumStrings(numbers) {
    let sum = 0;
    for (const str of numbers) {
      const n = parseInt(str.trim(), 10);
      if (!isNaN(n)) {
        sum += n;
      }
    }
    return sum;
  }

  /** Asks the user for numbers */
  async function askForNumbers(ctx: Context) {
    await ctx.reply("Send me your favorite numbers, separated by commas!");
  }

  /** Waits for the user to send numbers, and replies with their sum */
  async function sumUserNumbers() {
    const ctx = await conversation.waitFor(":text");
    const sum = sumStrings(ctx.msg.text);
    await ctx.reply("The sum of these numbers is: " + sum);
  }

  return { askForNumbers, sumUserNumbers };
}

/** A conversation to add numbers */
async function sumConvo(conversation: Conversation, ctx: Context) {
  const mod = sumModule(conversation);
  await mod.askForNumbers(ctx);
  await mod.sumUserNumbers();
}
```

```js [JavaScript]
/**
 * A module that can ask the user for numbers, and that
 * provides a way to add up numbers sent by the user.
 *
 * Requires a conversation handle to be injected.
 */
function sumModule(conversation: Conversation) {
  /** Converts all given strings to numbers and adds them up */
  function sumStrings(numbers) {
    let sum = 0;
    for (const str of numbers) {
      const n = parseInt(str.trim(), 10);
      if (!isNaN(n)) {
        sum += n;
      }
    }
    return sum;
  }

  /** Asks the user for numbers */
  async function askForNumbers(ctx: Context) {
    await ctx.reply("Send me your favorite numbers, separated by commas!");
  }

  /** Waits for the user to send numbers, and replies with their sum */
  async function sumUserNumbers() {
    const ctx = await conversation.waitFor(":text");
    const sum = sumStrings(ctx.msg.text);
    await ctx.reply("The sum of these numbers is: " + sum);
  }

  return { askForNumbers, sumUserNumbers };
}

/** A conversation to add numbers */
async function sumConvo(conversation: Conversation, ctx: Context) {
  const mod = sumModule(conversation);
  await mod.askForNumbers(ctx);
  await mod.sumUserNumbers();
}
```

:::

This is clearly overkill for such a simple task as adding up a few numbers.
However, it illustrates a broader point.

You guessed it:
It's just JavaScript.

## Persisting Conversations

By default, all data stored by the conversations plugin is kept in memory.
This means that when your process dies, all conversations are exited and will have to be restarted.

If you want to persist the data across server restarts, you need to connect the conversations plugin to a database.
We have built [a lot of different storage adapters](https://github.com/grammyjs/storages/tree/main/packages#grammy-storages) to make this simple.
(They are the same adapters that the [session plugin uses](./session#known-storage-adapters).)

Let's say you want to store data on disk in a directory called `convo-data`.
This means that you need the [`FileAdapter`](https://github.com/grammyjs/storages/tree/main/packages/file#installation).

::: code-group

```ts [Node.js]
import { FileAdapter } from "@grammyjs/storage-file";

bot.use(conversations({
  storage: new FileAdapter({ dirName: "convo-data" }),
}));
```

```ts [Deno]
import { FileAdapter } from "https://deno.land/x/grammy_storages/file/src/mod.ts";

bot.use(conversations({
  storage: new FileAdapter({ dirName: "convo-data" }),
}));
```

:::

Done!

You can use any storage adapter that is able to store data of type [`VersionedState`](/ref/conversations/versionedstate) of [`ConversationData`](/ref/conversations/conversationdata).
Both types can be imported from the conversations plugin.
In other words, if you want to extract the storage to a variable, you can use the following type annotation.

```ts
const storage = new FileAdapter<VersionedState<ConversationData>>({
  dirName: "convo-data",
});
```

Naturally, the same types can be used with any other storage adapter.

### Versioning Data

If you persist the state of the conversation in a database and then update the source code, there is a mismatch between the stored data and the conversation builder function.
This is a form of data corruption and will break the replay.

You can prevent this by specifying a version of your code.
Every time you change your conversation, you can increment the version.
The conversations plugin will then detect a version mismatch and migrate all data automatically.

```ts
bot.use(conversations({
  storage: {
    type: "key",
    version: 42, // can be number or string
    adapter: storageAdapter,
  },
}));
```

If you do not specify a version, it defaults to `0`.

::: tip Forgot to Change the Version? Don't Worry!

The conversations plugin already has good protections in place that should catch most cases of data corruption.
If this is detected, an error is thrown somewhere inside the conversation, which causes the conversation to crash.
Assuming that you don't catch and suppress that error, the conversation will therefore wipe the bad data and restart correctly.

That being said, this protection does not cover 100 % of the cases, so you should definitely make sure to update the version number in the future.

:::

### Non-serializable Data

[Remember](#conversations-store-state) that all data returned from [`conversation.external`](/ref/conversations/conversation#external) will be stored.
This means that all data returned from `conversation.external` must be serializable.

If you want to return data that cannot be serialized, such as classes or [`BigInt`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt), you can provide a custom serializer to fix this.

```ts
const largeNumber = await conversation.external({
  // Call an API that returns a BigInt (cannot be converted to JSON).
  task: () => 1000n ** 1000n,
  // Convert bigint to string for storage.
  beforeStore: (n) => String(n),
  // Convert string back to bigint for usage.
  afterLoad: (str) => BigInt(str),
});
```

If you want to throw an error from the task, you can specify additional serialization functions for error objects.
Check out [`ExternalOp`](/ref/conversations/externalop) in the API reference.

### Storage Keys

By default, conversation data is stored per chat.
This is identical to [how the session plugin works](./session#session-keys).

As a result, a conversation cannot handle updates from multiple chats.
If this is desired, you can [define your own storage key function](/ref/conversations/conversationoptions#storage).
As with sessions, it is [not recommended](./session#session-keys) to use this option in serverless environments due to potential race conditions.

Also, just like with sessions, you can store your conversations data under a namespace using the `prefix` option.
This is especially useful if you want to use the same storage adapter for both your session data and your conversations data.
Storing the data in namespaces will prevent it from clashing.

You can specify both options as follows.

```ts
bot.use(conversations({
  storage: {
    type: "key",
    adapter: storageAdapter,
    getStorageKey: (ctx) => ctx.from?.id.toString(),
    prefix: "convo-",
  },
}));
```

If a conversation is entered for a user with user identifier `424242`, the storage key will now be `convo-424242`.

Check out the API reference for [`ConversationStorage`](/ref/conversations/conversationstorage) to see more details about storing data with the conversations plugin.
Among other things, it will explain how to store data without a storage key function at all using `type: "context"`.

## Using Plugins Inside Conversations

[Remember](#conversational-context-objects) that the context objects inside conversations are independent from the context objects in the surrounding middleware.
This means that they will have no plugins installed on them by default---even if the plugins are installed on your bot.

Fortunately, all grammY plugins [except sessions](#accessing-sessions-inside-conversations) are compatible with conversations.
For example, this is how you can install the [hydrate plugin](./hydrate) for a conversation.

::: code-group

```ts [TypeScript]
// Only install the conversations plugin outside.
type MyContext = ConversationFlavor<Context>;
// Only install the hydrate plugin inside.
type MyConversationContext = HydrateFlavor<Context>;

bot.use(conversations());

// Pass the outside and the inside context object.
type MyConversation = Conversation<MyContext, MyConversationContext>;
async function convo(conversation: MyConversation, ctx: MyConversationContext) {
  // The hydrate plugin is installed on the parameter `ctx` here.
  const other = await conversation.wait();
  // The hydrate plugin is installed on the variable `other` here, too.
}
bot.use(createConversation(convo, { plugins: [hydrate()] }));

bot.command("enter", async (ctx) => {
  // The hydrate plugin is NOT installed on `ctx` here.
  await ctx.conversation.enter("convo");
});
```

```js [JavaScript]
bot.use(conversations());

async function convo(conversation, ctx) {
  // The hydrate plugin is installed on `ctx` here.
  const other = await conversation.wait();
  // The hydrate plugin is installed on `other` here, too.
}
bot.use(createConversation(convo, { plugins: [hydrate()] }));

bot.command("enter", async (ctx) => {
  // The hydrate plugin is NOT installed on `ctx` here.
  await ctx.conversation.enter("convo");
});
```

:::

In regular [middleware](../guide/middleware), plugins get to run some code on the current context object, then call `next` to wait for downstream middleware, and then they get to run some code again.

Conversations are not middleware, and plugins cannot interact with conversations in the same way as with middleware.
When a [context object is created](#conversational-context-objects) by the conversation, it will be passed to the plugins which can process it normally.
To the plugins, it will look like only the plugins are installed and no downstream handlers exist.
After all plugins are done, the context object is made available to the conversation.

As a result, any cleanup work done by plugins is performed before the conversation builder function runs.
All plugins except sessions work well with this.
If you want to use sessions, [scroll down](#accessing-sessions-inside-conversations).

### Default Plugins

If you have a lot of conversations that all need the same set of plugins, you can define default plugins.
Now, you no longer have to pass `hydrate` to `createConversation`.

::: code-group

```ts [TypeScript]
// TypeScript needs some help with the two context types
// so you often have to specify them to use plugins.
bot.use(conversations<MyContext, MyConversationContext>({
  plugins: [hydrate()],
}));
// The following conversation will have hydrate installed.
bot.use(createConversation(convo));
```

```js [JavaScript]
bot.use(conversations({
  plugins: [hydrate()],
}));
// The following conversation will have hydrate installed.
bot.use(createConversation(convo));
```

:::

Make sure to install the context flavors of all default plugins on the inside context types of all conversations.

### Using Transformer Plugins Inside Conversations

If you install a plugin via `bot.api.config.use`, then you cannot pass it to the `plugins` array directly.
Instead, you have to install it on the `Api` instance of each context object.
This is done easily from inside a regular middleware plugin.

```ts
bot.use(createConversation(convo, {
  plugins: [async (ctx, next) => {
    ctx.api.config.use(transformer);
    await next();
  }],
}));
```

Replace `transformer` by whichever plugin you want to install.
You can install several transformers in the same call to `ctx.api.config.use`.

### Accessing Sessions Inside Conversations

Due to the way [how plugins work inside conversations](#using-plugins-inside-conversations), the [session plugin](./session) cannot be installed inside a conversation in the same way as other plugins.
You cannot pass it to the `plugins` array because it would:

1. read data,
2. call `next` (which resolves immediately),
3. write back the exact same data, and
4. hand over the context to the conversation.

Note how the session gets saved before you change it.
This means that all changes to the session data get lost.

Instead, you can use `conversation.external` to get [access to the outside context object](#conversational-context-objects).
It has the session plugin installed.

```ts
// Read session data inside a conversation.
const session = await conversation.external((ctx) => ctx.session);

// Change the session data inside a conversation.
session.count += 1;

// Save session data inside a conversation.
await conversation.external((ctx) => {
  ctx.session = session;
});
```

In a sense, using the session plugin can be seen as a way of performing side-effects.
After all, sessions access a database.
Given that we must follow [The Golden Rule](#the-golden-rule-of-conversations), it only makes sense that session access needs to be wrapped inside `conversation.external`.

## Conversational Menus

You can define a menu with the [menu plugin](./menu) outside a conversation, and then pass it to the `plugins` array [like any other plugin](#using-plugins-inside-conversations).

However, this means that the menu does not have access to the conversation handle `conversation` in its button handlers.
As a result, you cannot wait for updates from inside a menu.

Ideally, when a button is clicked, it should be possible to wait for a message by the user, and then perform menu navigation when the user replies.
This is made possible by `conversation.menu()`.
It lets you define _conversational menus_.

```ts
let email = "";

const emailMenu = conversation.menu()
  .text("Get current email", (ctx) => ctx.reply(email || "empty"))
  .text(() => email ? "Change email" : "Set email", async (ctx) => {
    await ctx.reply("What is your email?");
    const response = await conversation.waitFor(":text");
    email = response.msg.text;
    await ctx.reply(`Your email is ${email}!`);
    ctx.menu.update();
  })
  .row()
  .url("About", "https://grammy.dev");

const otherMenu = conversation.menu()
  .submenu("Go to email menu", emailMenu, async (ctx) => {
    await ctx.reply("Navigating");
  });

await ctx.reply("Here is your menu", {
  reply_markup: otherMenu,
});
```

`conversation.menu()` returns a menu that can be built up by adding buttons the same way the menu plugin does.
If fact, if you look at [`ConversationMenuRange`](/ref/conversations/conversationmenurange) in the API reference, you will find it to be very similar to [`MenuRange`](/ref/menu/menurange) from the menu plugin.

Conversational menus stay active only as long as the conversation active.
You should call `ctx.menu.close()` for all menus before exiting the conversation.

If you want to prevent the conversation from exiting, you can simply use the following code snippet at the end of your conversation.
However, [remember](#conversations-store-state) that is it a bad idea to let your conversation live forever.

```ts
// Wait forever.
await conversation.waitUntil(() => false, {
  otherwise: (ctx) => ctx.reply("Please use the menu above!"),
});
```

Finally, note that conversational menus are guaranteed to never interfere with outside menus.
In other words, an outside menu will never handle the update of a menu inside a conversation, and vice-versa.

### Menu Plugin Interoperability

When you define a menu outside a conversation and use it to enter a conversation, you can define a conversational menu that takes over as long as the conversation is active.
When the conversation completes, the outside menu will take control again.

You first have to give the same menu identifier to both menus.

```ts
// Outside conversation (menu plugin):
const menu = new Menu("my-menu");
// Inside conversation (conversations plugin):
const menu = conversation.menu("my-menu");
```

In order for this to work, you must ensure that both menus have the exact same structure when you transition the control in or out of the conversation.
Otherwise, when a button is clicked, the menu will be [detected as outdated](./menu#outdated-menus-and-fingerprints), and the button handler will not be called.

The structure is based on the following two things.

- The shape of the menu (number of rows, or number of buttons in any row).
- The label on the button.

It is usually advisable to first edit the menu to a shape that makes sense inside the conversation as soon as you enter the conversation.
The conversation can then define a matching menu which will be active immediately.

Similarly, if the conversation leaves behind any menus (by not closing them), outside menus can take over control again.
Again, the structure of the menus has to match.

An example of this interoperability can be found in the [example bots repository](https://github.com/grammyjs/examples?tab=readme-ov-file#menus-with-conversation-menu-with-conversation).

## Conversational Forms

Oftentimes, conversations are used to build forms in the chat interface.

All wait calls return context objects.
However, when you wait for a text message, you may only want to get the message text and not interact with the rest of the context object.

Conversation forms give you a way to combine update validation with extracting data from the context object.
This resembles a field in a form.
Consider the following example.

```ts
await ctx.reply("Please send a photo for me to scale down!");
const photo = await conversation.form.photo();
await ctx.reply("What should be the new width of the photo?");
const width = await conversation.form.int();
await ctx.reply("What should be the new height of the photo?");
const height = await conversation.form.int();
await ctx.reply(`Scaling your photo to ${width}x${height} ...`);
const scaled = await scaleImage(photo, width, height);
await ctx.replyWithPhoto(scaled);
```

There are many more form fields available.
Check out [`ConversationForm`](/ref/conversations/conversationform#methods) in the API reference.

All form fields take an `otherwise` function that will run when a non-matching update is received.
In addition, they all take an `action` function that will run when the form field has been filled correctly.

```ts
// Wait for a basic calculation operation.
const op = await conversation.form.select(["+", "-", "*", "/"], {
  action: (ctx) => ctx.deleteMessage(),
  otherwise: (ctx) => ctx.reply("Expected +, -, *, or /!"),
});
```

Conversational forms even allow you to build custom form fields via [`conversation.form.build`](/ref/conversations/conversationform#build).

## Wait Timeouts

Every time you wait for an update, you can pass a timeout value.

```ts
// Only wait for one hour before exiting the conversation.
const oneHourInMilliseconds = 60 * 60 * 1000;
await conversation.wait({ maxMilliseconds: oneHourInMilliseconds });
```

When the wait call is reached, [`conversation.now()`](#the-golden-rule-of-conversations) is called.

As soon as the next update arrives, `conversation.now()` is called again.
If the update took more than `maxMilliseconds` to arrive, the conversation is halted, and the update is returned to the middleware system.
Any downstream middleware will be called.

This will make it look like the conversation was not active anymore at the time the update arrived.

Note that this will not actually run any code after exactly the specified time.
Instead, the code is only run as soon as the next update arrives.

You can specify a default timeout value for all wait calls inside a conversation.

```ts
// Always wait for one hour only.
const oneHourInMilliseconds = 60 * 60 * 1000;
bot.use(createConversation(convo, {
  maxMillisecondsToWait: oneHourInMilliseconds,
}));
```

Passing a value to a wait call directly will override this default.

## Enter and Exit Events

You can specify a callback function that is invoked whenever a conversation is entered.
Similarly, you can specify a callback function that is invoked whenever a conversation is exited.

```ts
bot.use(conversations({
  onEnter(id, ctx) {
    // Entered conversation `id`.
  },
  onExit(id, ctx) {
    // Exited conversation `id`.
  },
}));
```

Each callback receives two values.
The first value is the identifier of the conversation that was entered or exited.
The second value is the current context object of the surrounding middleware.

Note that the callbacks are only called when a conversation is entered or exited via `ctx.conversation`.
The `onExit` callback is also invoked when the conversation terminates itself via `conversation.halt` or when it [times out](#wait-timeouts).

## Concurrent Wait Calls

You can use floating promises to wait for several things concurrently.
When a new update arrives, only the first matching wait call will resolve.

```ts
await ctx.reply("Send a photo and a caption!");
const [textContext, photoContext] = await Promise.all([
  conversation.waitFor(":text"),
  conversation.waitFor(":photo"),
]);
await ctx.replyWithPhoto(photoContext.msg.photo.at(-1).file_id, {
  caption: textContext.msg.text,
});
```

In the above example, it does not matter if the user sends a photo or text first.
Both promises will resolve in the order the user picks to send the two messages the code is waiting for.
[`Promise.all`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all) works normally, it only resolves when all passed promises resolve.

This can be used to wait for unrelated things, too.
For example, here is how you install a global exit listener inside the conversation.

```ts
conversation.waitForCommand("exit") // no await!
  .then(() => conversation.halt());
```

As soon as the conversation [finishes in any way](#exiting-conversations), all pending wait calls will be discarded.
For example, the following conversation will complete immediately after it was entered, without ever waiting for any updates.

::: code-group

```ts [TypeScript]
async function convo(conversation: Conversation, ctx: Context) {
  const _promise = conversation.wait() // no await!
    .then(() => ctx.reply("I will never be sent!"));

  // Conversation is done immediately after being entered.
}
```

```js [JavaScript]
async function convo(conversation, ctx) {
  const _promise = conversation.wait() // no await!
    .then(() => ctx.reply("I will never be sent!"));

  // Conversation is done immediately after being entered.
}
```

:::

Internally, when several wait calls are reached at the same time, the conversations plugin will keep track of a list of wait calls.
As soon as the next update arrives, it will then replay the conversation builder function once for each encountered wait call until one of them accepts the update.
Only if none of the pending wait calls accepts the update, the update will be dropped.

## Checkpoints and Going Back in Time

The conversations plugin [tracks](#conversations-are-replay-engines) the execution of your conversations builder function.

This allows you to create a checkpoint along the way.
A checkpoint contains information about how far the function has run so far.
It can be used to later jump back to this point.

Naturally, any actions performed in the meantime will not be undone.
In particular, rewinding to a checkpoint will not magically unsend any messages.

```ts
const checkpoint = conversation.checkpoint();

// Later:
if (ctx.hasCommand("reset")) {
  await conversation.rewind(checkpoint); // never returns
}
```

Checkpoints can be very useful to "go back."
However, like JavaScript's `break` and `continue` with [labels](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/label), jumping around can make the code less readable.
**Make sure not to overuse this feature.**

Internally, rewinding a conversation aborts execution like a wait call does, and then replays the function only until the point where the checkpoint was created.
Rewinding a conversation does not literally execute functions in reverse, even though it feels like that.

## Parallel Conversations

Conversations in unrelated chats are fully independent and can always run in parallel.

However, by default, each chat can only have a single active conversation at all times.
If you try to enter a conversation while a conversation is already active, the `enter` call will throw an error.

You can change this behavior by marking a conversation as parallel.

```ts
bot.use(createConversation(convo, { parallel: true }));
```

This changes two things.

Firstly, you can now enter this conversation even when the same or a different conversation is already active.
For example, if you have the conversations `captcha` and `settings`, you can have `captcha` active five times and `settings` active twelve times---all in the same chat.

Secondly, when a conversation does not accept an update, the update is no longer dropped by default.
Instead, control is handed back to the middleware system.

All installed conversations will get a chance to handle an incoming update until one of them accepts it.
However, only a single conversation will be able to actually handle the update.

When multiple different conversations are active at the same time, the middleware order will determine which conversation gets to handle the update first.
When a single conversation is active multiple times, the oldest conversation (the one that was entered first) gets to handle the update first.

This is best illustrated by an example.

::: code-group

```ts [TypeScript]
async function captcha(conversation: Conversation, ctx: Context) {
  const user = ctx.from!.id;
  await ctx.reply("Welcome to the chat! What is the best bot framework?");
  const answer = await conversation.waitFor(":text").andFrom(user);
  if (answer.msg.text === "grammY") {
    await ctx.reply("Correct! Your future is bright!");
  } else {
    await ctx.banAuthor();
  }
}

async function settings(conversation: Conversation, ctx: Context) {
  const user = ctx.from!.id;
  const main = conversation.checkpoint();
  const options = ["Chat Settings", "About", "Privacy"];
  await ctx.reply("Welcome to the settings!", {
    reply_markup: Keyboard.from(options
      .map((btn) => [Keyboard.text(btn)])),
  });
  const option = await conversation.waitFor(":text")
    .andFrom(user)
    .and((ctx) => options.includes(ctx.msg.text), {
      otherwise: (ctx) => ctx.reply("Please use the buttons!"),
    });
  await openSettingsMenu(option, main);
}

bot.use(createConversation(captcha));
bot.use(createConversation(settings));
```

```js [JavaScript]
async function captcha(conversation, ctx) {
  const user = ctx.from.id;
  await ctx.reply("Welcome to the chat! What is the best bot framework?");
  const answer = await conversation.waitFor(":text").andFrom(user);
  if (answer.msg.text === "grammY") {
    await ctx.reply("Correct! Your future is bright!");
  } else {
    await ctx.banAuthor();
  }
}

async function settings(conversation, ctx) {
  const user = ctx.from.id;
  const main = conversation.checkpoint();
  const options = ["Chat Settings", "About", "Privacy"];
  await ctx.reply("Welcome to the settings!", {
    reply_markup: Keyboard.from(options
      .map((btn) => [Keyboard.text(btn)])),
  });
  const option = await conversation.waitFor(":text")
    .andFrom(user)
    .and((ctx) => options.includes(ctx.msg.text), {
      otherwise: (ctx) => ctx.reply("Please use the buttons!"),
    });
  await openSettingsMenu(option, main);
}

bot.use(createConversation(captcha));
bot.use(createConversation(settings));
```

:::

The above code works in group chats.
It provides two conversations.
The conversation `captcha` is used to make sure that only good developers join the chat (shameless grammY plug lol).
The conversation `settings` is used to implement a settings menu in the group chat.

Note that all wait calls filter for a user identifier, among other things.

Let's assume that the following has already happened.

1. You called `ctx.conversation.enter("captcha")` to enter the conversation `captcha` while handling an update from a user with identifier `ctx.from.id === 42`.
2. You called `ctx.conversation.enter("settings")` to enter the conversation `settings` while handling an update from a user with identifier `ctx.from.id === 3`.
3. You called `ctx.conversation.enter("captcha")` to enter the conversation `captcha` while handling an update from a user with identifier `ctx.from.id === 43`.

This means that three conversations are active in this group chat now---`captcha` is active twice and `settings` is active once.

> Note that `ctx.conversation` provides [various ways](/ref/conversations/conversationcontrols#exit) to exit specific conversations even with parallel conversations enabled.

Next, the following things happen in order.

1. User `3` sends a message containing the text `"About"`.
2. An update with a text message arrives.
3. The first instance of the conversation `captcha` is replayed.
4. The `waitFor(":text")` text call accepts the update, but the added filter `andFrom(42)` rejects the update.
5. The second instance of the conversation `captcha` is replayed.
6. The `waitFor(":text")` text call accepts the update, but the added filter `andFrom(43)` rejects the update.
7. All instances of `captcha` rejected the update, so control is handed back to the middleware system.
8. The instance of the conversation `settings` is replayed.
9. The wait call resolves and `option` will contain a context object for the text message update.
10. The function `openSettingsMenu` is called.
    It can send an about text to the user and rewind the conversation back to `main`, restarting the menu.

Note that even though two conversations were waiting for the the users `42` and `43` to complete their captcha, the bot correctly replied to user `3` who had started the settings menu.
Filtered wait calls can determine which updates are relevant for the current conversation.
Disregarded updates fall through and can be picked up by other conversations.

The above example uses a group chat to illustrate how conversations can handle multiple users in parallel in the same chat.
In reality, parallel conversations work in all chats.
This lets you wait for different things in a chat with a single user.

You can combine parallel conversations with [wait timeouts](#wait-timeouts) to keep the number of active conversations low.

## Inspecting Active Conversations

Inside your middleware, you can inspect which conversation is active.

```ts
bot.command("stats", (ctx) => {
  const convo = ctx.conversation.active("convo");
  console.log(convo); // 0 or 1
  const isActive = convo > 0;
  console.log(isActive); // false or true
});
```

When you pass a conversation identifier to `ctx.conversation.active`, it will return `1` if this conversation is active, and `0` otherwise.

If you enable [parallel conversations](#parallel-conversations) for the conversation, it will return the number of times that this conversation is currently active.

Call `ctx.conversation.active()` without arguments to receive an object that contains the identifiers of all active conversations as keys.
The respective values describe how many instances of each conversation are active.

If the conversation `captcha` is active twice and the conversation `settings` is active once, `ctx.conversation.active()` will work as follows.

```ts
bot.command("stats", (ctx) => {
  const stats = ctx.conversation.active();
  console.log(stats); // { captcha: 2, settings: 1 }
});
```

## Migrating From 1.x to 2.x

Conversations 2.0 is a complete rewrite from scratch.

Even though the basic concepts of the API surface remained the same, the two implementations are fundamentally different in how they operate under the hood.
In a nutshell, migrating from 1.x to 2.x results in very little adjustments to your code, but it requires you to drop all stored data.
Thus, all conversations will be restarted.

### Data Migration From 1.x to 2.x

There is no way to keep the current state of conversations when upgrading from 1.x to 2.x.

You should just drop the respective data from your sessions.
Consider using [session migrations](./session#migrations) for this.

Persisting conversations data with version 2.x can be done as described [here](#persisting-conversations).

### Type Changes Between 1.x and 2.x

With 1.x, the context type inside a conversation was the same context type used in the surrounding middleware.

With 2.x, you must now always declare two context types---[an outside context type and an inside context type](#conversational-context-objects).
These types can never be the same, and if they are, you have a bug in your code.
This is because the outside context type must always have [`ConversationFlavor`](/ref/conversations/conversationflavor) installed, while the inside context type must never have it installed.

In addition, you can now install an [independent set of plugins](#using-plugins-inside-conversations) for each conversation.

### Session Access Changes Between 1.x and 2.x

You can no longer use `conversation.session`.
Instead, you must use `conversation.external` for this.

```ts
// Read session data.
const session = await conversation.session; // [!code --]
const session = await conversation.external((ctx) => ctx.session); // [!code ++]

// Write session data.
conversation.session = newSession; // [!code --]
await conversation.external((ctx) => { // [!code ++]
  ctx.session = newSession; // [!code ++]
}); // [!code ++]
```

> Accessing `ctx.session` was possible with 1.x, but it was always incorrect.
> `ctx.session` is no longer available with 2.x.

### Plugin Compatibility Changes Between 1.x and 2.x

Conversations 1.x were barely compatible with any plugins.
Some compatibility could be achieved by using `conversation.run`.

This option was removed for 2.x.
Instead, you can now pass plugins to the `plugins` array as described [here](#using-plugins-inside-conversations).
Sessions need [special treatment](#session-access-changes-between-1-x-and-2-x).
Menus have improved compatibility since the introduction of [conversational menus](#conversational-menus).

### Parallel Conversation Changes Between 1.x and 2.x

Parallel conversations work the same way with 1.x and 2.x.

However, this feature was a common source of confusion when used accidentally.
With 2.x, you need to opt-in to the feature by specifying `{ parallel: true }` as described [here](#parallel-conversations).

The only breaking change to this feature is that updates no longer get passed back to the middleware system by default.
Instead, this is only done when the conversation is marked as parallel.

Note that all wait methods and form fields provide an option `next` to override the default behavior.
This option was renamed from `drop` in 1.x, and the semantics of the flag were flipped accordingly.

### Form Changes Between 1.x and 2.x

Forms were really broken with 1.x.
For example, `conversation.form.text()` returned text messages even for `edited_message` updates of old messages.
Many of these oddities were corrected for 2.x.

Fixing bugs technically does not count as a breaking change, but it is still a substatial change in behavior.
