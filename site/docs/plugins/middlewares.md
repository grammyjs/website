# Set of useful middlewares

I kept rewriting the same middlewares again and again for all of my bots so I decided to extract them all to a separate package.

## Installation

`yarn add grammy-middlewares`

## Usage

All the middleware accessors are factories, even though not all of them have to be.
I decided to make API homogeneous.

Some of the factories consume optional or required parameters.

```typescript
import {
  ignoreOld,
  onlyAdmin,
  onlyPublic,
  onlySuperAdmin,
  sequentialize,
} from "grammy-middlewares";

// ...

bot.use(
  ignoreOld(),
  onlyAdmin((ctx) => ctx.reply("Only admins can do this")),
  onlyPublic((ctx) => ctx.reply("You can only use public chats")),
  onlySuperAdmin(env.SUPER_ADMIN_ID),
  sequentialize(),
);
```

## Middlewares

### `ignoreOld`

Ignores old updates, useful when bot has been down for a while.
You can optionaly specify the timeout in seconds which defaults to `5 * 60`.

### `onlyAdmin`

Checks if the user is an admin.
You can optionally specify `errorHandler` that is called with the context if the user is not an admin.

### `onlyPublic`

Checks if it is a group chat or a channel.
You can optionally specify `errorHandler` that is called with the context if it is not a group chat or a channel.

### `onlySuperAdmin`

Checks if the user is a super admin.
You have to provide the super admin id.

### `sequentialize`

The basic [sequentialize](../advanced/scaling.md#concurrency-is-hard) middleware that takes the chat id as a sequential identifier.
