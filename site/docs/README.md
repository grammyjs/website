## Quickstart

Bots are written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) (or JavaScript) and run on various platforms, including [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).

`npm install grammy` and paste the following code:

::: code-group

```ts [TypeScript]
import { Bot } from "grammy";

const bot = new Bot(""); // <-- put your bot token between the "" (https://t.me/BotFather)

// Reply to any message with "Hi there!".
bot.on("message", (ctx) => ctx.reply("Hi there!"));

bot.start();
```

```js [JavaScript]
const { Bot } = require("grammy");

const bot = new Bot(""); // <-- put your bot token between the "" (https://t.me/BotFather)

// Reply to any message with "Hi there!".
bot.on("message", (ctx) => ctx.reply("Hi there!"));

bot.start();
```

```ts [Deno]
import { Bot } from "https://deno.land/x/grammy/mod.ts";

const bot = new Bot(""); // <-- put your bot token between the "" (https://t.me/BotFather)

// Reply to any message with "Hi there!".
bot.on("message", (ctx) => ctx.reply("Hi there!"));

bot.start();
```
