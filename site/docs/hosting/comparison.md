# Comparison of Hosting Providers

There are many different hosting providers that allow you to run your bot.
It can sometimes be hard to keep track of how much they cost and how good their performance is.
This is why the grammY community is collecting their experiences on this page.

## What is a Hosting Provider?

In order to keep a bot online 24 hours a day, you need to run a computer 24 hours a day.
As [mentioned in the introduction](/guide/introduction.html#how-to-keep-a-bot-running), you most likely don't want to do that with your laptop or home computer.
Instead, you can ask a company to run the bot in the cloud.

In other words, you just run it on someone else's computer.

## Comparison Tables

We have two comparison tables, one for [serverless](#serverless) hosting and one for [VPS](#vps).

### Serverless

Serverless means that you do not control a single machine on which your bot is run.
Instead, these hosting providers will rather allow you to upload your code, and then start and stop different machines as necessary to make sure that your bot always works.

This has the downside that your bot does not have access to a persistent storage by default, such as a local file system.
Instead, you will often have to have a database separately and connect to it if you need to store data permanently.
We therefore recommend you to use a different kind of hosting for more complex bots, e.g. a [VPS](./vps.md).

The main thing to know about them is that on serverless infrastructures you are required to use webhooks.

### VPS

A virtual private server is a virtual machine that you have full control over.
You can usually access it via [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell).
You can install any software there, and you are responsible for system upgrades and so on.

On a VPS, you can run bots using both polling or webhooks.
