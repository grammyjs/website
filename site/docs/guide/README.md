# Overview

Welcome to grammY!
You've come to the right place.

grammY is a framework for creating Telegram bots.
It can be used from TypeScript and JavaScript and runs on Node.js, Deno, and in the browser.

Check out the [Introduction](./introduction.md) if you're new to writing Telegram bots, especially if you have little coding experience.

If you know how to write an application in Node.js or have already created a Telegram bot with another JavaScript framework, get up and running in minutes with our [Getting Started](./getting-started.md) guide.

There are two main parts of this documentation.
The first one (you're looking at it!) introduces the concepts behind both grammY and Telegram bots in general, and helps you understand how grammY makes your life easier.
Check out the Learn section to see the available information.
You may also want to read up about our great plugins that help you with building rich menus, storing data, translating your bot to multiple languages, and much more.

The second part is the grammY [API Reference](https://doc.deno.land/https/deno.land/x/grammy/mod.ts), linked at the top of the page.
This is a detailed overview of every single bit of code and every option that grammY provides.
It is automatically generated from the code and contains detailed descriptions about every part of the library.
You can see it as a complete collection of all of the useful “tooltip explanations”, normally found by hovering your cursor over any element of grammY in a code editor.
Some central topics of grammY have brief outlines in the API Reference too.
