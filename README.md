```bash
npm run docs:dev
```

to view the documentation in your browser.

## Checking Correct Formatting of Docs

In addition to the VSCode extension that lints the Markdown, [Deno](https://deno.land/) formatting is used to check the formatting of markdown files and the TypeScript and JavaScript code contained in them.
You can use the following two commands the `site/` directory.

```bash
# Checks if all files are fomatted correctly
deno fmt --config deno.json --check

# Automatically formats all files directly
deno fmt --config deno.json
```

You can also run

```bash
npm run docs:fmt
```

to perform the formatting.
Note that you still need to have Deno installed.
