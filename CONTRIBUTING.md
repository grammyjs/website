# Contribution Guide

## Editing the documentation

You're free to edit the documentation in any way you like, and suggest the
changes in a PR. If we merge it, they'll go live immediately.

If you are planning on adding completely new pages, you may want to ask in
[the group chat](https://t.me/grammyjs) if those changes are welcome.

Remember that you can edit a page directly in the browser by clicking the link
at the bottom of each page. That makes it very easy to fix typos and other small
things, as you don't even have to clone this repository.

## Translations

It is possible to translate the website to new languages. You're very welcome to
help translate the documentation into your language.

Note that we're taking translations very seriously. They should receive as much
love as the English version.

For example, Google Translate is already built into Google Chrome. Don't bother
using software to create translations of the docs. If we create a translation of
the docs for a new language, then because we want high quality translations
written by native speakers or near native speakers. Examples and real-world
comparisons must be replaced by equivalents in the culture of the respective
country. A good translation is hard and it takes time. We don't want partial or
outdated translations.

Anyone who wants to start a new language should ask themselves the following
questions before putting any work into docs.

1. How much of the documentation do you want to translate? If the answer isn't
   to get to 100 % eventually, don't start.

2. How long are you going to stick around in bot development? grammY is young.
   It evolves quickly and there are many articles that get changed often. The
   translations must be kept in sync with the English original. Outdated and
   wrong docs are much worse than no docs. Many people only come here for a few
   months (and that's fine!) but if you translate everything and then stop
   developing bots and stop updating the articles, we'll have to remove that
   language again. Then it was a waste of time for you. So if you don't want to
   commit long-term, don't start.

3. How many hours per week can you spend in the beginning? It's understandable
   that a first PR doesn't contain translations for all pages immediately.
   However, if you can only work on it rarely, it's going to take a very long
   time until you're done. We don't want to end up with 15 languages and none of
   them is done for months. If you can't set aside enough free time to get this
   done, don't start.

We are looking forward to your contributions!
