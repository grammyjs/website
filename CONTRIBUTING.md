# Contribution Guide

## Editing the documentation

You're free to edit the documentation in any way you like, and suggest the changes in a PR.
If we merge it, they'll go live immediately.

> **IMPORTANT:** Please write exactly one sentence per line in order to preserve readable `git diff`s.

If you are planning on adding completely new pages, you may want to ask in [the group chat](https://t.me/grammyjs) if those changes are welcome.

Remember that you can edit a page directly in the browser by clicking the link at the bottom of each page.
That makes it very easy to fix typos and other small things, as you don't even have to clone this repository.

Larger changes typically undergo a review process and a few iterations before they are merged and published.
We have observed that the following workflow works well, and we usually try to stick with it:

1. You (or someone else) starts a PR of unknown quality with a change to the English docs.
2. Someone else (or you) reviews and comments it, the participants iterate over the changes until they're good.
3. A member of @grammyjs approves the PR and adds the label "read for translation".
4. All translation happens and the labels for the respective languages are added.
5. The PR now has at least one approval and all translations are ready, so it can be merged.

## Translations

It is possible to translate the website to new languages.
You're very welcome to help translate the documentation into your language.

Note that we're taking translations very seriously.
They should receive as much love as the English version.

For example, Google Translate is already built into Google Chrome.
Don't bother using software to create translations of the docs.
If we create a translation of the docs for a new language, then because we want high quality translations written by native speakers or near-native speakers.
Examples and real-world comparisons must be replaced by equivalents in the culture of the respective country.
A good translation is hard and it takes time. We don't want partial or outdated translations.

Anyone who wants to start a new language should ask themselves the following questions before putting any work into docs.

1. How much of the documentation do you want to translate?
   If the answer isn't to get to 100 % eventually, don't start.
2. How long are you going to stick around in bot development? grammY is young.
   It evolves quickly and there are many articles that get changed often.
   The translations must be kept in sync with the English original.
   Outdated and wrong docs are much worse than no docs.
   Many people only come here for a few months (and that's fine!) but if you translate everything and then stop developing bots and stop updating the articles, we'll have to remove that language again.
   Then it was a waste of time for you.
   So if you don't want to commit long-term, don't start.
3. How many hours per week can you spend in the beginning?
   It's understandable that a first PR doesn't contain translations for all pages immediately.
   However, if you can only work on it rarely, it's going to take a very long time until you're done.
   We don't want to end up with 15 languages and none of them is done for months.
   If you can't set aside enough free time to get this done, don't start.

With that out of the way, here are some recommendations that will make your life easier.

1. Find another native speaker that can review your translations.
   We cannot merge pull requests that have not been reviewed, because they tend to have typos or other small mistakes.
   In addition, we found that reviews often lead to much better phrasing.
   However, we can of course only review contributions to languages we speak.
   It therefore makes a lot of sense if you find at least one other person who can speak your language so that you can work on it together.
2. Create an issue for progress tracking.
   It could look somewhat like https://github.com/grammyjs/website/issues/55.
   Make sure you do not lose track of your translations.
   We can also create such an issue for you, just ping us in the [group chat](https://t.me/grammyjs).
3. Re-create the structure first.
   It makes a lot of sense to create empty pages that only contain “TODO translate” but that follow the same structure as the English original.
   Again, we can of course create that for you if you send us a message.

You are now ready to translate https://grammy.dev!
We are looking forward to your contributions!
