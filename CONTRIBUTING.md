# Contribution Guide

## Editing the documentation

You're free to edit the documentation in any way you like, and suggest the changes in a PR.
If we merge it, they'll go live immediately.

If you are planning on adding completely new pages, you may want to ask in [the group chat](https://t.me/grammyjs) if those changes are welcome.

Remember that you can edit a page directly in the browser by clicking the link at the bottom of each page.
That makes it very easy to fix typos and other small things, as you don't even have to clone this repository.

## Translations

It is possible to translate the website to new languages.
You're very welcome to help translate the documentation into your language.

Note that we're taking translations very seriously.
They should receive as much love as the English version.

For example, Google Translate is already built into Google Chrome.
Don't bother using software to create translations of the docs.
If we create a translation of the docs for a new language, then because we want high quality translations written by native speakers or near native speakers.
Examples and real-world comparisons must be replaced by equivalents in the culture of the respective country.
A good translation is hard and it takes time. We don't want partial or outdated translations.

Anyone who wants to start a new language should ask themselves the following questions before putting any work into docs.

1. How much of the documentation do you want to translate?
   If the answer isn't to get to 100 % eventually, don't start.
2. How long are you going to stick around in bot development? grammY is young.
   It evolves quickly and there are many articles that get changed often.
   The translations must be kept in sync with the English original.
   Outdated and wrong docs are much worse than no docs.
   Many people only come here for a few months (and that's fine!) but if you translate everything and then stop developing bots and stop updating the articles, we'll have to remove that language again.
   Then it was a waste of time for you.
   So if you don't want to commit long-term, don't start.

3. How many hours per week can you spend in the beginning?
   It's understandable that a first PR doesn't contain translations for all pages immediately.
   However, if you can only work on it rarely, it's going to take a very long time until you're done.
   We don't want to end up with 15 languages and none of them is done for months.
   If you can't set aside enough free time to get this done, don't start.

We are looking forward to your contributions!
