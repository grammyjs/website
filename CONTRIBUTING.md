## Editing the Documentation

You’re free to edit the documentation in any way you like, and suggest the changes in a PR.
If we merge it, they’ll go live immediately.

> **IMPORTANT:** Please write exactly one sentence per line in order to preserve readable `git diff`s.

If you are planning on adding completely new pages, you may want to ask in the [group chat](https://t.me/grammyjs) if those changes are welcome.

Remember that you can edit a page directly in the browser by clicking the link at the bottom of each page.
That makes it very easy to fix typos and other small things, as you don’t even have to clone this repository.

Larger changes typically undergo a review process and a few iterations before they are merged and published.
We have observed that the following workflow works well, and we usually try to stick with it:

1. You (or someone else) starts a PR of unknown quality with a change to the English docs.
2. Someone else (or you) reviews and comments it, the participants iterate over the changes until they’re good.
3. A member of @grammyjs approves the PR and adds the label “ready for translation”.
4. All translation happens and the labels for the respective languages are added.
5. The PR now has at least one approval and all translations are ready, so it can be merged.

## Translating

See the [Translation Guide](./TRANSLATING.md).
